1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
This project contains code for analises of low pile-up dijets in FSQ subgroup, 
particularly for analises like dijets k-factor and dijets decorrelations, 
looking for BFKL effects in pQCD.

This project takes input data from *.root files produced by 
other projects
	 - https://github.com/ipozdnyakov/cmssw_jets.git	-each file conatains TTree with one entry for each jet in the event
	 - https://github.com/ipozdnyakov/CommonFSQFramework	-each file conatains TTree with one entry for each event


2. ENVIRONMENT
--------------
Project is written to be run within CMSSW environment. 
Current version is used - CMSSW_7_4_15.
Top level of the project repository should be placed in /CMSSW_X_X_X/src/. 


3. CONTENT OF THE PROJECT
-------------------------
/Docs		- contains detailed information on various aspects of the analysis, 
		  additional to this readme.txt 

	/listing	- contains lists of files from 13TeV_DATA - output of 
		  	git@github.com:ipozdnyakov/cmssw_jets project		- data stored in /afs/cern.ch/work/i/ivanp/CMSSW_SKIMS/
		  	git@github.com:ipozdnyakov/CommonFSQFramework  project	- data stored in /afs/cern.ch/work/i/ivanp/CFF_SOFT/CFF_SKIMS/

	/jec_txt	- contains *.txt files with JEC and uncertainties

maker_gcc	- shell script to compile the code to k_factor.exe, wich is the "final button"

main.cpp	- main code of the analysis

Source/Include  - *.cpp and *.h files correspondingly


	dataset.cpp/.h		- class "Dataset" for storing files and names for data in files

	measurement.cpp/.h	- class "Measurement" - combination of several observables
				>> push each event to each observable

	observable.cpp/.h	- class "Observable" = sample + object + function = some distribution
				>> check if event entry in the sample	- Sample->CheckEvent(event)
				>> construct object from event		- Object->LoadEvent(event)
				>> calculate function from object	- Function->CalculateValues(object)

	sample.cpp/.h		- class "Sample" for set of events (central, minbias, merged, etc.)
	object.cpp/.h		- class "Object" for phenomena from event (MN, incl dijets, etc.)
	function.cpp/.h		- class "Function" for particular values from  phenomena (pt, dphi, dy, etc.)

	result.cpp/.h		- class "Result" calculation on several observables = some plot (eff, k_factor, decorr, etc.)

	event.cpp/.h		- class "Event" for event data (nPV, triggers, weigth, jets, etc.)

	bining.h		- global definition of bining arrays

	finder.cpp/.h		- set of functions to find required dijet in vectors


4. FUNCTIONALITY
----------------------------

class Measurement	- the main class over which all functionality is realised

/access_to_the_data	- [DONE] class "Dataset" to manage TTree name, branch names in TTrees and path to listing
			  Measurement -> ReadDataset() -> ReadFile() -> ReadEvent(), Observable -> ReadEvent()

/efficiency_calc	- [DONE] class "Sample" to measure observables on various sets of events
			  based on triggers + selection - "central_trg", "forward2_trg", "forward3_trg" samples
			  based on dataset  + selection - "unbiased" sample

/samples_merging	- [DONE] new samples for calculating weights and merging
			  based on dataset 		 - "low_pthat", "high_pthat" samples
			  based on datasets and triggers - "central", "central_no_fwd", "forward" samples
			  based on reweighting		 - "merged" sample
			 //weight of forward for pt35 and eta 2.1 is 0.3, but stats decreases by less than 1%

/pileup			- [IN PROGRESS] the same as for JEC, but reference file not written yet

/jec_study		- [DONE] jet energy correction  study  of  the   data,   for   each 
			  observable from  the  set  of  observables  it  plots  observable
			  on  jets   with pt_plus_unc and pt_minus_unc

/mc_processing		- [TO BE DONE]

/jer_study		- [TO BE DONE]

/phi&eta_res		- [TO BE DONE]

/unfolding		- [TO BE DONE]

/final_values		- [DONE] class "Result" which calculate some values according to the instructions labeled by its name

/total_syst		- [IN PROGRESS] class "Result"

/syst_correlations	- [TO BE DONE]
