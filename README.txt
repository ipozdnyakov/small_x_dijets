1. INTRODUCTION

This project contains code for analyses of low pile-up dijets in FSQ subgroup, particularly for 
analyses like dijet k-factor and dijets decorrelations, looking for BFKL effects in pQCD.

This project takes input data from .root files produced by https://github.com/ipozdnyakov/cmssw_jets.git,
each file conatains TTree with one entry for each jet in the event.

2. ENVIROMENT

Project is written to be run within CMSSW enviroment. Current version is used - CMSSW_7_4_15.
Top level of the project repository should be placed in /CMSSW_X_X_X/src/.
